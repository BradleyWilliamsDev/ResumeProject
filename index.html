    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Game Designer, developer, and software engineer. During my studies
      I focused on the development side of making games.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my 3 years of study I received 2 awards one for the best project
      throughout the entire university, and the second award was for the best
      game created.
    </p>

    <p>
      To conclude my studies I was required to do work for a company. I ended up
      doing mine at the software development firm BBD. I was only required to be
      there for a week but ended up being asked to stay for longer and the time
      I ended up being there was 3 months.
